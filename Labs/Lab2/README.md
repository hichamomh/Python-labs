# Lab2 

## Objectives 

Acquire practice with libraries commonly used in data science (`numpy`, `scipy`, `pandas`, `hdf5`, `matplotlib`).

## Assessment 

This lab session will be evaluated, based on your answer to the exercises reported in the Jupyter notebook.\
Any code produced should be commented whenever appropriate, custom functions and objects documented and unit-tested (see Lab1).\
Figures produced should be clearly annotated (axis, title, legend whenever appropriate).

Your aswers will be evaluated depending on:
1. Numerical correctness
2. Implementation clarity (documentation, relevance of the comments)
3. Unit-tests developed whenever appropriate (correctness, relevance)
4. Answers to the questions and overall presentation of the Jupyter notebook.

## Submission Guidelines

You will have to submit a .zip file named LAST_NAME1-LAST_NAME1-Lab2.zip with your solutions, containing:

- The notebook LAST_NAME1-LAST_NAME1-Lab2.ipynb with your solutions;
- All the necessary files for the full execution of your notebook (.py files etc);
- All .py files for unit tests and .npy and .hdf5 for saving vectors;
- A few .png files containing some of your results

Please make sure that the size of your zip file is not larger than 5MB.

The deadline is October 11, at 23:59, upload your zip file using this Dropbox file request:

## Late Policy

Each day delay will result in -2 points (the labs are scored out of 20).
