# Lab3 

## Objectives 

Further practice with common libraries and algorithms (numpy.fft, matplotlib, seaborn).

## Assessment 

This lab session will be evaluated, based on your answer to the exercises reported in the Jupyter notebook.\
Any code produced should be commented whenever appropriate, custom functions and objects documented and unit-tested (see Lab1).\
Figures produced should be clearly annotated (axis, title, legend whenever appropriate).

Your aswers will be evaluated depending on:
1. Numerical correctness
2. Implementation clarity (documentation, relevance of the comments)
3. Answers to the questions and overall presentation of the Jupyter notebook.

## Submission Guidelines

You will have to submit just the notebook named LAST_NAME1-LAST_NAME1-Lab2.ipnyb with your solutions.

The deadline is October 14, at 23:59, upload your jupyter notebook using this Dropbox file request:
