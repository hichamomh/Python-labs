Figures produced should be clearly annotated (axis, title, legend whenever appropriate).

Your aswers will be evaluated depending on:
1. Numerical correctness
2. Implementation clarity (documentation, relevance of the comments)
3. Answers to the questions and overall presentation of the Jupyter notebook.
